## Questions
1. Git is a Version Control System or Source Code Management System. Github is just a platform that utilizes Git.
2. Commit is making changes on your local repository while pushing is making the changes in the online/remote repository.
3. The trunk is the main repository branch that holds a guaranteed working version of the project. Feature branches are separate from the trunk and usually are terminated very shortly after their implementation through merging or their failure.
4. The reason you would want to protect your trunk branch is to ensure there is always a working copy to present/use. To protect your trunk branch, we add branch security rules that ensure certain checks are passed before pull requests can be merged to the branch itself.
